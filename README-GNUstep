About the GNUstep port
======================

This port was done using a recent (r25225) svn trunk revision of
GNUstep (http://www.gnustep.org). The system used for the port is running
FreeBSD 6.2-STABLE, which has a native kqueue() implementation. Also,
I used the fusefs BSD port from the ports collection, fusefs-kmod-0.3.0_5.

It's probably a good idea to include autoconf magic for figuring out all
compile time requirements, but for the time being it's just not here.


FUSEObjC-GNUstep
================

This is a port of FUSEObjC (original version referenced in the FUSEObjC
folder) which basically removes all HFS+ and Finder related stuff. This
should be generic enough to allow for compilation on systems other than
Mac OS X.
