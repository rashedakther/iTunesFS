What is it?
===========

iTunesFS allows you to mount the "iTunes Music Library.xml" file as a file
system, using the excellent MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/).
All playlists are exposed as directories, with their respective entries.
Order of tracks within the playlists is maintained by prefixing the tracks
with their playlist index.

Defaults
========

Name               | Type | DefVal | Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DetailedTrackNames | BOOL | NO     | If YES, use very detailed information
                                     in track names (Album title, Artist,
                                     track number, etc.)


TODO / IDEAS
============

- Expose Library and iPods at root mount point
  - need to be able to identify (easy) and parse (more difficult, but already
    did that for PodLifter) iPod databases
  - abstract iTunesLibrary (superclass: Library) and add iPodLibrary
  - Listen for attached/detached iPods
