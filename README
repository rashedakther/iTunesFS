What is it?
===========

iTunesFS allows you to mount your local iTunes library and locally mounted
iPods/iPhones as a single file system mount point, exposing all the details
like artists, albums and playlists as separate directories with their
respective entries. The naming of tracks and playlists within these directories
is highly configurable.

Please note that you have to install OSXFUSE before you can use iTunesFS!
OSXFUSE is available at http://osxfuse.github.com/.

As of version 1.1.3, you can also build this application using GNUstep on any
supported unix-like system (i.e. FreeBSD). Please read README-GNUstep for
further information regarding FUSE and GNUstep.
